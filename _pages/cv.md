About
======
I hold a Ph.D. in [General Linguistics](https://www.tu.berlin/linguistik) (summa cum laude) from the [Technical University of Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/) (2021-2024). During my doctoral studies, I focused on speech patterns and tropes related to contemporary antisemitism, racism, and conspiracy fantasies, examining how these ideologies manifest and become disseminated through [user-generated content](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content) (UGC) on social media platforms.

Prior to my Ph.D., I completed a Master’s degree in Inclusion/Exclusion at [Regensburg University of Applied Sciences](https://www.oth-regensburg.de/en/) (2018-2019). I also hold a Bachelor’s degree in Social Work from the same institution (2013-2017), which not only sparked my interest in science as a student assistant at the [Institute for Social Research and Technology Assessment](https://rcai.de/en/category/ist/) (IST), but also provided me with valuable knowledge in statistics and quantitative data analysis, as well as a solid theoretical background in social sciences, particularly in the field of youth pedagogy.

I also pursued graduate studies in Linguistics and American Studies at the [University of Regensburg](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/en) (2019-2020), though I decided not to complete the program in order to focus on my Ph.D. research.

As an interdisciplinary researcher, my aim is to bridge Computational Social Science, Linguistics and Pedagogy informing both my research and teaching.

  
Fellowships
======
From 2021 to 2024, I held a Ph.D. Fellowship from the [Hans Böckler Foundation](https://www.boeckler.de/), which allowed me to focus on my doctoral research. Prior to that, I was granted a Graduate Fellowship from the [Studienstiftung des Deutschen Volkes](https://www.studienstiftung.de/en) from 2017 to 2019. 


Memberships
======
Since July 2023, I have been a member of the [Gesellschaft für Sprachtechnologie und Computerlinguistik](https://www.gscl.org/) (GSCL).
I also participate in the AK Antisemitismusforschung within the [Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie](https://soziologie.de/sektionen/arbeitskreise-und-arbeitsgruppen) (since October 2021), where I engage with interdisciplinary research on antisemitism. Additionally, I have been a member of the [Deutsch-Israelische Gesellschaft e.V.](https://www.deutsch-israelische-gesellschaft.de/) (DIG) since 2017, reflecting my commitment to fostering German-Israeli relations.

Expertise
======
Throughout my academic career, I have gained knowledge in computational linguistics and computational social science, developing a broad set of skills that include content analysis, cyber monitoring, and both qualitative corpus analysis and quantitative techniques using inferential statistics. I also have expertise in natural language processing and text mining, along with a range of technical skills, including proficiency in Python, R, Jira, Excel, and LaTeX.
