Studying the extent of online hate speech and antisemitism is essential to understanding the dynamics of digital discourse, which can help predict ongoing societal changes beyond the digital realm. However, the underlying factors that make antisemitic narratives so persuasive are frequently overlooked. This project focuses on the often-neglected emotive layers in the study of digital media that influence the spread of hate speech and antisemitism. It examines how frequently users devalue Jews and Israel, contrasting these expressions with those directed at opposing entities, including instances of sympathy for, or even endorsement of, violent actors such as Hamas. 

*Beyond* **the written word**, the project analyzes the **multifaceted layers of political communication** by utilizing cutting-edge technology that incorporates both **audio and visual signals** into its analysis, aiming to understand and scale the dynamics that create fertile ground for hostility in digital realms.

**Key questions driving the project include:**
```
a) What methodological advances are necessary to analyze online hate and measure multimodal content effectively?  
b) How can these dynamics be **robustly measured at scale** and tracked longitudinally?  
c) What **recurring visual frames** appear in today’s increasingly dominant short-form video content?  
d) Which metrics best explain why **polarizing narratives spread** widely on social platforms?
```
These questions are addressed through a series of high-quality NLP-based research papers.

The paper series conducts empirical research on how political narratives circulate online by analyzing international news content, particularly on YouTube—the second most visited website worldwide. It focuses on state-funded and state-supported outlets, such as **Al Jazeera, the BBC, Deutsche Welle, and TRT World**. Using a longitudinal approach, the project measures the proportionality and dynamics of content related to the aftermath of the **Israel–Hamas war since October 7, 2023**.

## Empirical Studies

### Study 4: How to Investigate Short‑Form Video Content — A Pipeline for Multimodal Analysis *(under review)*

This study shifts the analytical focus to the **videos themselves** by examining audio and visual layers of short-form news content. It introduces a **multimodal pipeline** that combines automatic transcription, sentiment analysis, and **visual scene classification** to analyze variation in sentiment and framing **across outlets and over time**.

### Study 3: Mapping Affective Polarization in YouTube Shorts — A Data‑Driven Analysis of Political Communication During the 2023–2024 Israel–Hamas War *(under review)*

This study examines **affective polarization** in user responses to short-form news content published by **state-funded media outlets**. The analysis reveals systematic differences in sentiment toward **key geopolitical and ideological entities**, with disproportionately negative evaluations of **Israel** and **Zionism**, contrasted with more positive or sympathetic evaluations of **Palestine** and **Palestinians**. These patterns indicate **polarized evaluative dynamics** in audience reactions and discuss how **affective narratives** and emotionally charged language shape political communication in Web 2.0 environments.

### Study 2: Analyzing Polarization in Online Discourse on the 2023–2024 Israel–Hamas War

*Proceedings of the 21st Conference on Natural Language Processing (KONVENS 2025): Workshops, pages 7–16, Hannover, Germany.*  
**Download paper:** <https://aclanthology.org/2025.konvens-2.1/>

This study applies **large-scale sentiment analysis** to the same corpus to track longitudinal changes in **user attitudes** over the course of one year. The analysis shows that aggregate sentiment trends **reflect reactions to geopolitical developments**, while also demonstrating that **meaningful interpretation requires pairing automated analysis with domain expertise**.

### Study 1: Investigating Polarization in YouTube Comments via Aspect‑Based Sentiment Analysis

*Proceedings of the 15th International Conference on Recent Advances in Natural Language Processing – NLP in the Generative AI Era (RANLP 2025).*  
**Download paper:** <https://aclanthology.org/2025.ranlp-1.83/>

This study uses **aspect‑based sentiment analysis (ABSA)** to analyze polarization in online discourse based on **more than three million** user comments and replies from **YouTube Shorts**. A manually annotated subset is used to **train and evaluate a domain‑adapted ABSA model**. The results show that fine‑grained sentiment analysis provides reliable insights into **how politically and ideologically charged topics are discussed** over time and across outlets.
