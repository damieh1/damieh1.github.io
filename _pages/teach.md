## Teaching

### Digital Media Analysis and Online Antisemitism** *(Summer 2026)*, Graduate Lecture, University of Haifa

- [Course Description](https://holocauststudies.haifa.ac.il/images/2025-2026/Summer_schedule_25-26.pdf)
- This course explores the contemporary manifestations of antisemitism and Holocaust distortion across digital platforms such as YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, and Telegram. Students will examine how different forms of Jew-hatred are disseminated through various media formats—including videos, memes, texts, and semiotic markers—and analyze the socio-political contexts that facilitate their dissemination. Through a multidisciplinary lens, the course combines theoretical frameworks from Holocaust studies, linguistics, and digital humanities. Students will work in research groups on their own case study projects, participate in critical discussions, and apply digital tools to acquire, annotate, and analyze user-generated content both qualitatively and quantitatively. The course sheds light on state-of-the-art approaches to empirical analysis, emphasizes ethical considerations in working with online data, and guides students in developing their own research projects to address pertinent issues in social media discourse.
